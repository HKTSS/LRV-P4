Speed Limit:
All LRV are now equipped with iSPS. iSPS will warn if the train is overspeeding, and will apply brake if the driver haven't opened the door on a station.
Beacon 12 is used to set the speed limit. If there is no beacon 12 in the route, the default speed limit(60km/h) will be used.
*The speedlimit can be changed midway by adding another beacon.
*Speedlimit smaller than 1 km/h will be ignored

Usage (xx = Speed Limit in km/h):
.beacon 12;-1;0;xx


Beacon 13 is used to define the start of a station.
The iSPS system will apply brake once the train has stopped(when approaching stations). Player must open the door in order to continue driving.
This is used to prevent when the driver forgot to open the door, then continue to the next station unknowingly.

Usage:
.beacon 13;-1;0

Beacon 14 is used to define the light rail route.
This will automatically set the LED destination sign if an vaild LRT route code is entered.
*Not all display is available due to the complexity and performance
